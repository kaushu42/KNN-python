# KNN implementation in python

This is a KNN implementation in python.
I have used a dummy donut-shaped dataset and I use KNN to classify the points.

You can see how points are classified visually from the plots.

The main KNN class is based purely in python and numpy.

Feel free to use and improve the implementation.
